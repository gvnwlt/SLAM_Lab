# SLAM_Lab

## A ROS Simulator Setup (Gazebo 9)
This is a simple ROS simulator setup complete with the launch files and sensor plugins you need so all you have to do is download run it (or at least with minimal configuration). You can run any bot with this, but I for the most part use 'janky_bot' to run with in the simulator. Eventually I will be adding a bunch of different SLAM packages to run with and test out.
